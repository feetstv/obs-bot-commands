On Windows 10 1803 and prior, we recommend disabling the "Game DVR Background Recording" feature. This will ensure OBS Studio has access to the resources needed for realtime streaming/recording. See [Windows Gaming Features Troubleshooting] for instructions.

On Windows 10 1809 (and later) and Windows 11, you can keep safely this feature enabled without impacting OBS Studio performance.
