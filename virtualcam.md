OBS Studio provides a virtual camera plugin that allows you to share your OBS Studio output with applications that can make use of a camera, such as Discord, Skype, Teams, etc. See the [Virtual Camera Guide](https://obsproject.com/kb/virtual-camera-guide) to learn how to use the virtual camera.

If the virtual camera is not installed or causing issues in other applications, follow [Virtual Camera Troubleshooting](https://obsproject.com/kb/virtual-camera-troubleshooting).

- **macOS**: follow the [macOS compatibility](https://obsproject.com/kb/virtual-camera-troubleshooting#macos-compatibility) section if you are having issues with specific applications.
- **Linux**: v4l2loopback is required to use the virtual camera. Install it via the `v4l2loopback-dkms` package.
