Certain Elgato video capture products are not fully compatible with OBS Studio on macOS. However, the following workarounds allow you to use these devices:

- **Elgato HD & HD60**: use a macOS Screen Capture/Window source to capture the Elgato Game Capture app running in full screen window mode.
- **Elgato HD60 S**: on Intel-based Macs, use the above method **or** [OBS Link](https://help.elgato.com/hc/articles/360031363132), an NDI-based workaround that adds compatibility with OBS Studio. This device is **not** compatible with Apple Silicon-based Macs.
- **Elgato HD60 S+, Cam Link**: you do not need any special apps to use this device with OBS Studio.
- **Elgato 4K60 S+**: this device is only compatible with Windows; you can use it on an Intel-based Mac running Boot Camp.
