Running a game without vertical sync (V-Sync) or a frame rate limiter may cause performance issues. This is because all of the GPU's resources are allocated to running your game; there won't be enough resources left for OBS Studio.

[Enable V-Sync or set a reasonable frame rate limit](https://obsproject.com/kb/encoding-performance-troubleshooting#limit-game-framerate) that your GPU can handle without hitting 100% usage. You may also need to [reduce graphics settings](https://obsproject.com/kb/encoding-performance-troubleshooting#reduce-graphical-settings) in the game.
